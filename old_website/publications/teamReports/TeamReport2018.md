## The Team

## Organization of Preparation Camps for the Austrian Open 2017
Together with [Fabasoft](www.fabasoft.com) we organized special robotics camps to significantly increase the number of Upper Austrian teams taking part in the RoboCup Junior.

In this cooperation we were able to build 15 teams from scratch within a time frame of four months. Moreover we succeeded to build the winning team, two teams winning a second price and two winning a third price in this competition.
