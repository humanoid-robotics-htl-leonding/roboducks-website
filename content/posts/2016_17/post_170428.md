The RoboCupJunior Austrian Open offered a Demo Humanoid Challenge for the first time and our team was part of this challenge. We were able to win the second price with a technically perfect software but a bit too careless when making the Nao friendly and nice. Nevertheless a big congrats to the team Stefan Brandmair and Karl Gruber.
