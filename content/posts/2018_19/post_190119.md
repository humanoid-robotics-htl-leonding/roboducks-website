This dance carries the motto *Leonding 2030*. Our robots welcome the guests, and guide them through the first minutes of the ball. As a highlight the Naos will open the ball together with *Leonie* the Avatar of the HTL Leonding [A footage of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBva_K3JlfY&feature=youtu.be) shows the result.
