We were invited to the *We Are Developers World Congress 2018* in Vienna. On the Junior Track we presented first steps to programming of humanoid robots. It is a great feeling to be part of a conference where the big shots like Joel Spolsky give a talk.
Thanks to the CoderDojo Vienna who invited us to be there.
