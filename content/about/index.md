# Humanoid Robotics @ HTL Leonding
Humanoid Robotics is a part of the HTL Leonding's *Program of Excellence* which offers a range of different intensive courses. The main aim of Humanoid Robotics is to motivate students of our school to solve complex problems in the field of

- Computer Vision
- Autonomous Systems
- Voice Recognition
- Artificial Intelligence

The course is open for all students from 2nd to 5th grade who are interested in the above mentioned areas. The prerequisites are a good knowledge in programming and a strong focus in solving complex technical problems.

The course offers the following two tracks:

1. Basic Humanoid Behavior
2. Robo Soccer

The Basic Humanoid Behavior addresses basic problems in programming humanoid robots like autonomous movements, natural interaction with humans, face recognition, speech recognition, etc. It is closely connected to the [Demo Humanoid Challenge](https://robocupjunior.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Demo-Humanoid-Competition-2018-V1-5-1-FINAL.pdf) yearly held during the Austrian Open of the RoboCup Junior.

In the Robo Soccer track the central aim is to build the software necessary to get a robo team for the [Standard Platform League](http://spl.robocup.org) of the RoboCup.

# RoboDucks - The Name
Back in 2016 when the first concrete plans for a participation in the Standard Platform League emerged the initial members of our Humanoid Robotics Team (Sabina Brantner, Melanie MÃ¼hleder, and Viki Streibl, together with their coach Peter Bauer, yes we were only four at this time) travelled their way to Leipzig to visit the RoboCup International being held there at this time.

During the stay in Leipzig kind a behavioral pattern popped up seeing the mentor rushing in front while the three girls followed him going in single file. After a while the mentor heard a silent "quack" from one of the girls mimicking the noise of a duck. Well, from this time onwards the naming problem was solved.
